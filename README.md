Command line tool for digital signature of PDF files, useful for example in Batch processes, from non Java programming languages like Php, Shell scripts, etc...
 
BatchPDFSign is a command line to sign PDF file with a PKCS12 certificate.

To use it you need: 
- a PKCS12 certificate. It should be a <filename>.pfx file.
- a password for the .pfx
- and a PDF file to sign.

## self signed certificate creation
You can create your own self signed certificate with this following 4 commands in Ubuntu.

```bash
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out myself.key 2048
openssl req -new -days 365 -key myself.key -out myself.csr
openssl x509 -in myself.csr -out myself.crt -req -signkey myself.key -days 365
openssl pkcs12 -export -out myself.pfx -inkey myself.key -in myself.crt
```
